as well with the main result of your paper.

Brief figure caption.


## Abstract

Paste here the abstract.


## Reproducing the results

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO.git

or [click here to download a zip archive](https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO/archive/master.zip).

*Describe here the folder structure and what is in each folder. Suggested
layout would be:*

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The data used in this study is provided in `data` and the sources for the
manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.

The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
You can view a static (non-executable) version of the notebooks in the
[nbviewer]() webservice:

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO

Also provided are read-only PDF versions of the notebooks.

See sections below for instructions on executing the code.


### Setting up your environment

Describe what you need to install. Usually it's Anaconda with Python 2.7. Here
is template for that:

> You'll need a working Python **2.7** environment with all the standard
> scientific packages installed (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc).  The easiest
> (and recommended) way to get this is to download and install the
> [Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads#all).
> Make sure you get the **Python 2.7** version.

If you need Fatiando, use this:

> You'll also need to install version X.Y of the
> [Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org/) library.
> See the install instructions on the website.

If you provide a conda environment through an `environment.yml` file, use:

> You can use `conda` package manager (included in Anaconda) to create a
> virtual environment with all the required packages installed.
> Run the following command in the repository folder (where `environment.yml`
> is located):

    conda env create

> To activate the conda environment, run

    source activate moho

> or, if you're on Windows,

    activate moho

> This will enable the environment for your current terminal session.

I would recommend having a bash shell with `make` installed in Windows to make
life easier for everyone. Put these instructions if you want this:

> **Windows users:** It is highly recommended that you install the bash shell
> to run code and produce the results here.
> You can download bash for Windows at http://git-for-windows.github.io/.
> Install the "Git for Windows SDK" that will come with bash and `make` as
> well.


### Running the code

If using Jupyter notebooks, use this text:

> To execute the code in the Jupyter notebooks, you must first start the
> notebook server by going into the repository folder and running:

    jupyter notebook

> Make sure you have the `conda` environment enabled first.

> This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
> interface. In the page, go into the `code` folder and select the
> notebook that you wish to view/run.

> The notebook is divided cells (some have text while other have code).
> Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.
> Executing text cells does nothing and executing code cells runs the code
> and produces it's output.
> To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order.
